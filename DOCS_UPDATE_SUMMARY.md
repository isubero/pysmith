## üéØ Key Changes Made

### Before (Outdated)

```python
# Manual FK assignment
class Book(Model):
    id: int
    title: str
    author_id: int  # Manual

book = Book(id=1, title="Book", author_id=author.id)
```

### After (Current) ‚úÖ

```python
# ORM-style with Annotated
class Book(Model):
    id: int
    title: str
    author: Annotated[Optional["Author"], Relation()] = None
    # author_id auto-generated!

book = Book(id=1, title="Book", author=author)  # ‚ú® FK auto-extracted
```

## üìä Current Feature Set (Documented)

### ‚úÖ Implemented & Documented

1. **Model class** with Pydantic validation
2. **Django-style ORM** (save, find, delete)
3. **Hidden session management**
4. **Type-safe relationships** with `Annotated`
5. **Auto FK generation**
6. **ORM-style object assignment**
7. **Self return types** for type safety
8. **Relationship updates**
9. **Multiple relationships** per model
10. **Self-referential relationships**

### üöß Next (Documented in Roadmap)

1. Lazy loading relationships
2. Query builder (filter, where, order_by)
3. Eager loading / prefetch
4. Async support
5. Many-to-many

## üß™ Verification

All examples run successfully:

```bash
‚úÖ django_style_orm_example.py - Shows ORM-style relationships
‚úÖ relationships_example.py - Comprehensive relationship examples
‚úÖ type_safety_example.py - Type safety demonstration
```

All tests pass:

```bash
‚úÖ 86 tests total
‚úÖ 25 relationship tests
‚úÖ All passing
```

## üìã Files NOT Modified (Already Accurate)

- `RELATIONSHIPS.md` - Already shows ORM-style
- `RELATIONSHIPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Already technical and current
- `TYPE_SAFETY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Focused on Self type, still relevant
- `CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md` - Older doc, still valid
- `MODEL_SQLALCHEMY_CONVERSION.md` - Specific to conversion, still valid
- `RELATIONSHIP_STRATEGIES.md` - Older doc, still conceptually valid
- Other examples (sqlalchemy_pydantic_example.py, etc.) - Still valid
