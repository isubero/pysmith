# Lazy Loading Implementation Summary

## üéâ **Feature Complete: Automatic Relationship Loading!**

Pysmith now supports **lazy loading** - accessing a relationship automatically queries the related object. No manual joins needed!

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### The Magic

```python
# Before (manual joins)
book = Book.find_by_id(1)
author = Author.find_by_id(book.author_id)  # Manual query
print(author.name)

# Now (lazy loading) ‚ú®
book = Book.find_by_id(1)
print(book.author.name)  # Auto-loads author!
```

### Core Components

#### 1. `LazyLoader` Descriptor Class

A Python descriptor that intercepts attribute access and lazy-loads relationships:

```python
class LazyLoader:
    """Descriptor for lazy-loading relationships."""

    def __get__(self, obj, objtype=None):
        # Check cache first
        if cached:
            return cached_value

        # Query the related object
        related_obj = TargetModel.find_by_id(fk_value)

        # Cache it
        cache_result(related_obj)

        return related_obj

    def __set__(self, obj, value):
        # Update both cache and FK
        cache(value)
        extract_fk(value)
```

#### 2. Model Registry

Track all Model subclasses to resolve forward references:

```python
_model_registry: dict[str, type["Model"]] = {}

def __init_subclass__(cls):
    """Auto-register models by name."""
    Model._model_registry[cls.__name__] = cls
```

#### 3. Lazy Loader Setup

Automatically set up descriptors when model is first used:

```python
def _setup_lazy_loaders(cls):
    """Replace relationship fields with LazyLoader descriptors."""
    for rel_field in relationships:
        if has_foreign_key:
            loader = LazyLoader(rel_field, target_model, fk_field)
            setattr(cls, rel_field, loader)  # Replace field with descriptor
```

## üéØ How It Works

### Architecture

```
User accesses book.author
  ‚Üì
LazyLoader.__get__() intercepted
  ‚Üì
Check cache (_lazy_author)
  ‚Üì (if not cached)
Get FK value (book.author_id)
  ‚Üì
Query: Author.find_by_id(author_id)
  ‚Üì
Cache result
  ‚Üì
Return Author object
```

### Caching Strategy

- **Cache key**: `_lazy_{relationship_name}` (e.g., `_lazy_author`)
- **Cached on**: First access
- **Cache invalidated**: When relationship is updated via assignment
- **Benefit**: Prevents repeated queries for same relationship

## üìä Test Coverage

**9 comprehensive lazy loading tests (all passing):**

1. ‚úÖ **Basic lazy load** - Access relationship, loads automatically
2. ‚úÖ **Caching** - Second access returns cached object
3. ‚úÖ **None relationships** - Returns None without querying
4. ‚úÖ **Update handling** - Lazy loads after relationship update
5. ‚úÖ **Multiple relationships** - Multiple lazy loaders on same model
6. ‚úÖ **Relationship chains** - Navigate multi-level relationships
7. ‚úÖ **find_all support** - Lazy loading works with all query methods
8. ‚úÖ **Assignment updates cache** - Setting relationship updates lazy cache
9. ‚úÖ **Self-referential** - Lazy load parent/child relationships

**Total**: 95 tests passing (up from 86!)

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from typing import Annotated, Optional
from pysmith.models import Model, Relation

class Author(Model):
    id: int
    name: str

class Book(Model):
    id: int
    title: str
    author: Annotated[Optional["Author"], Relation()] = None

# Create data
author = Author(id=1, name="Jane").save()
book = Book(id=1, title="Guide", author=author).save()

# Query and lazy load
found = Book.find_by_id(1)
print(found.author.name)  # ‚ú® Auto-loads! No manual query!
```

### Chains

```python
# Navigate multi-level relationships
review = Review.find_by_id(1)
print(review.book.author.name)  # ‚ú® Lazy loads both book and author!
```

### Multiple Relationships

```python
post = Post.find_by_id(1)
print(post.author.username)    # ‚ú® Lazy loads author
print(post.reviewer.username)  # ‚ú® Lazy loads reviewer
```

### Caching

```python
book = Book.find_by_id(1)
author1 = book.author  # Queries database
author2 = book.author  # Returns cached (no query!)
assert author1 is author2  # Same object
```

### Updates

```python
book = Book.find_by_id(1)
book.author = new_author  # Updates cache and FK
book.save()
# Next access returns new_author
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Descriptor Pattern

Python descriptors intercept attribute access:

```python
class Book(Model):
    author = LazyLoader("author", "Author", "author_id")  # Descriptor set on class

book = Book(...)
book.author  # Calls LazyLoader.__get__(book, Book)
book.author = author_obj  # Calls LazyLoader.__set__(book, author_obj)
```

### Forward Reference Resolution

Handles string type hints like `"Author"`:

```python
# At class definition time
author: Annotated[Optional["Author"], Relation()] = None

# At runtime (when first used)
_setup_lazy_loaders():
    target_class = Model._model_registry.get("Author")
    # Stores resolved class for lazy loader to use
```

### Type Safety Preservation

Descriptors are transparent to type checkers:

```python
# Type checker sees:
author: Annotated[Optional["Author"], Relation()] = None

# Runtime has:
author = LazyLoader(...)  # Descriptor

# Both work together:
book.author  # Type: Optional[Author] ‚úì
            # Runtime: Lazy loads ‚úì
```

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Good: Caching

```python
book = Book.find_by_id(1)
book.author  # Query 1: Loads author
book.author  # No query! Returns cache
```

### Aware: N+1 Problem

```python
# This triggers N+1 queries (one per book)
for book in Book.find_all():
    print(book.author.name)  # Each book queries its author

# Solution: Eager loading (coming in next phase!)
for book in Book.find_all(prefetch=['author']):
    print(book.author.name)  # All authors loaded in one query
```

## üé® Design Decisions

### Why Descriptors?

**Alternatives considered:**

1. `__getattribute__` override - ‚ùå Too invasive
2. Manual `.get_author()` methods - ‚ùå Not automatic
3. Property decorators - ‚ùå Can't be dynamic
4. **Descriptors** - ‚úÖ Perfect fit!

**Why descriptors win:**

- ‚úÖ Intercept access automatically
- ‚úÖ Type-safe (transparent to type checkers)
- ‚úÖ Can cache results
- ‚úÖ Standard Python pattern
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns

### Why Setup on First Use?

Lazy loaders are set up when `_get_or_create_sqlalchemy_model()` is called:

**Benefits:**

- Only set up for models actually used
- Forward references resolved by then
- No performance impact at import time
- Works with any model definition order

### Why Per-Instance Caching?

Cache stored on instance (`_lazy_author`), not class:

**Benefits:**

- Each instance has its own cache
- Thread-safe
- Natural lifecycle (GC cleans up with instance)
- No global state issues

## üìà Impact

### Before Lazy Loading

```python
# Every relationship = manual join
book = Book.find_by_id(1)
author = Author.find_by_id(book.author_id)
publisher = Publisher.find_by_id(book.publisher_id)

# Chains were painful
review = Review.find_by_id(1)
book = Book.find_by_id(review.book_id)
author = Author.find_by_id(book.author_id)
```

**Issues:**

- ‚ùå Verbose
- ‚ùå Easy to forget
- ‚ùå Breaks flow
- ‚ùå Not ORM-like

### After Lazy Loading ‚ú®

```python
# Just access the relationship!
book = Book.find_by_id(1)
print(book.author.name)
print(book.publisher.city)

# Chains are natural
review = Review.find_by_id(1)
print(review.book.author.name)
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Concise
- ‚úÖ Automatic
- ‚úÖ Natural flow
- ‚úÖ True ORM experience

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Phase 4: Eager Loading

Solve the N+1 problem:

```python
# Load all authors in one query
books = Book.find_all(prefetch=['author'])
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional queries!
```

### Phase 4: Collection Lazy Loading

Lazy load one-to-many relationships:

```python
author = Author.find_by_id(1)
for book in author.books:  # ‚Üê Lazy load all books
    print(book.title)
```

## üìä Statistics

- **Lines added**: ~120
- **New tests**: 9
- **Total tests**: 95 (all passing ‚úÖ)
- **Performance**: Cached, minimal overhead
- **Type safety**: Fully preserved ‚úÖ
- **Breaking changes**: None

| Access relationship | ‚ùå Manual query | ‚úÖ Just access it |
| Type safety         | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| Caching             | ‚ùå None         | ‚úÖ Automatic      |
| Chains              | ‚ö†Ô∏è Painful      | ‚úÖ Natural        |
